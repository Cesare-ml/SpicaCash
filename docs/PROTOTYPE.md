# SpicaCash ERC-20 prototype

**Status: experimental, not audited, not deployed.** This source code must not be represented as a live VirgoStars cryptocurrency.

## Contract

`src/SpicaCash.sol` inherits the plain OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation, using a pinned `@openzeppelin/contracts@5.4.0` dependency. The constructor takes:

1. `initialHolder` — nonzero wallet/treasury address receiving all tokens.
2. `initialSupplyBaseUnits` — strictly positive integer, denominated in **smallest units**, where `1 SPICA = 10^18 base units`.

These constructor arguments are intentionally **not predetermined**; the final economic supply and treasury structure require approval. Test fixtures use an arbitrary *example* supply of one million SPICA, **not** a tokenomics decision.

The contract deliberately has **no owner, no upgradeable proxy, no admin minting function, no pause/blacklist, no transaction fees, no rebasing and no built-in rewards mechanism**. All units are minted once, to the constructor recipient. Its deployment-time fixed supply is not an endorsed public token issuance.

## Local setup

Install Node.js (20+) and [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation), including `forge` and `cast`. For Windows, WSL2 with Linux tooling is recommended.

```bash
npm install
forge build
forge test -vv
forge test --match-test testFuzz -vv
```

The project contains plain Solidity tests with no forge-std dependency. Unit tests check constructor errors, token metadata, transfer amount conservation, allowances and insufficient-balance/allowance reverts. Three fuzz tests cover supply conservation, delegated transfers and overspending. It does not yet contain a stateful invariant harness, formal verification or an independent audit.

**Never** run tests on a production fork with real signing credentials.

## Arbitrum Sepolia-only helper

The guarded helper `scripts/deploy-arbitrum-sepolia.sh` checks the RPC's chain ID is **421614** before even offering a testnet broadcast. By default it is preflight-only (no transaction).

```bash
export ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"
export SPICA_TESTNET_HOLDER="<testnet-receiving-address>"
export SPICA_TESTNET_SUPPLY_BASE_UNITS="1000000000000000000"
bash scripts/deploy-arbitrum-sepolia.sh
```

The sample above represents **one test SPICA** in base units. This will only check the network and arguments; **it does not deploy anything**. After independent test review and an explicit human decision for a testnet-only transaction, a separate explicit confirmation plus `FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT` (local Foundry keystore name) are required. Do not enter seed phrases or private keys into source files, chat, command-line arguments or the repo. **Do not use mainnet credentials.**

## Product boundary

SpicaCash is not an AI-credit payment method and cannot be used to buy VirgoStars credits in the first release. No integration with the VirgoStars backend, website or desktop exists.

## Open decisions / launch gates

- Agree token supply, recipients, allocations, vesting, treasury multisig, and user rights.
- Check ticker/name collisions and complete legal and MiCA analysis.
- Consider security reviews, stronger invariant/fuzzing tests and ecosystem threat scenarios.
- Independently verify testnet bytecode and published addresses.
- Explicitly authorize any public/mainnet deployment in a later decision.
